# react-portfolio

Ongoing work in project, this portfolio has been built using React and React-Bootstrap.

## Description
This website has been created using React and React-Bootstrap.

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
* When the portfolio is first loaded, the user is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
* Header displays the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
* Navigation titles display the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* WHEN the navigation title is clicked, the user is presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
* When the portfolio is loaded for the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default
* About Me page displays a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
* Portfolio page displays titled images of six or more of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
* Contact page displays a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
    * If email is not valid or message is not present, error message is displayed below the submit button
* Resume (file icon) button links to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
* Footer displays text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

Issues that are still being addressed: 
* Error messages on contact form only display upon submit, not when clicked away
* Contact form is not functional
* Resume is not its own page, but a link on the contact section and about me section
* Images on Portfolio page take an extra second or two to load

Notes to self:
* Need to consolidate verbiage on LinkedIn
* Add Coursera certifications
